# LiLabYale

## 1. Introduction

LiLabYale is a research laboratory focused on systems neuroscience, led by Prof. Chiang-shan R. Li at Yale Univeristy School of Medicine. By combining psychophysics, computational modeling and brain imaging, we explore the circuit mechanisms of a multitude of cognitive constructs, including self control, affect regulation, and reward-related processes. The primary goals are to understand systems neural bases of these cognitive processes and how these neural processes contribute to the etiology of psychiatric and neurological illnesses, with a specific emphasis on addiction.
